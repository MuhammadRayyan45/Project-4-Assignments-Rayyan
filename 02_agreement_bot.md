Problem Statement
rite a program which asks the user what their favorite animal is, and then always responds with "My favorite animal is also ___!" (the blank should be filled in with the user-inputted animal, of course).

Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics - note the space between the prompt and the user input!):

What's your favorite animal? cow

My favorite animal is also cow!


def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()


    def main():
    # User se favorite animal poochhna
    favorite_animal = input("What's your favorite animal? ")

    # Jawab print karna
    print(f"My favorite animal is also {favorite_animal}!")


# Ye line main() function ko call karti hai jab file run hoti hai
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
